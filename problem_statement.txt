Challenge: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-url-shortener/

Requirements:

-> An API POST Request will be made in which a long_url input will be given and in return we will mapped
this long_url with short_url and return it back to the client.

-> Long URL ----> mapped to -----> Short URL

-> Response
{
    "key":"wsf5f",
    "long_url":"https://www.google.com",
    "short_url":"http://localhost/wsf5f"
}

-> Few Key-notes to keep in mind,
1.) When the URL already exists you can return the same status code and existing shortened version of the 
    URL. In other words the API call to create a shortened URL should be idempotent.

2.) Add a check to ensure that a duplicate key that is generated from a different long URL is handled. One 
    option might be to add a unique value to the hash input and re-hash.
